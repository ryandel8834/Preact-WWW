# Installation
To get started with Preact CLI, install it from [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/preact-cli):

```shell
npm i -g preact-cli
```

This installs a global `preact` command, which we'll use to set up a new projects.

## Project creation

### Templates
Use one of our official templates to get started

- **Default**

This template is a great starting point for most applications. It comes with `preact-router` and a couple sample routes, and does route-based code splitting by default.

- **Simple**

A "bare bones" template, starting from a "Hello World" application. If you're looking to chose your own tools or already have a setup in mind, this is a good way to start.

- **Material**

This template comes pre-configured with [preact-material-components](https://material.preactjs.com) and a small example app to get you started quickly and easily.

- **Netlify CMS**

  If you're looking for your next blog, look no further. This template has Netlify CMS pre-configured and gives you a simple elegant blog for you.

To get started with these templates just do

```shell
preact create <template-name> <app-name>
```

This will create the folder and install all the dependencies.

```shell
cd <app-name>
npm run dev/build
```

## Production builds
Run `npm run build` to create production build which will reside in `build` directory in the app folder.

Production builds can be fine tuned to match your needs with a series of flags. Find the full linst of flags [here](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli#preact-build).

**Usage Example:**

e.g.

This will generate webpack's asset json which can be used in a webpack [analyzer](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/).

```shell
preact build --json
```

## Editing index.html
If you want to add or edit the markup generated by `preact-cli` to add meta tags, custom scripts or fonts, then you can edit `src/template.html`:
This is generated by `preact-cli` v3.

Otherwise, if you're upgrading from an old version you can create `template.html` in `src` folder which will be picked automatically.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title><% preact.title %></title>
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
		<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
		<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
		<% preact.headEnd %>
	</head>
	<body>
		<% preact.bodyEnd %>
	</body>
</html>
```
