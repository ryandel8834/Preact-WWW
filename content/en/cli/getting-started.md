# Installation
Getting started with Preact-CLi is just about download preact-cli node module.

```shell
npm i -g preact-cli
```

This installs a global command `preact`, which can be used to create, develop and build preact PWAs henceforth.

## Project creation

### Templates
Use one of our official templates to get started

- **Default**

  This template comes configured with `preact` and `preact-router` to get you started with your app development without any bloat.

- **Simple**

  This tempalte is an open playing groung. With no deps installed, you are free to choose your own tools.

- **Material**

  If you are a material design lover this template comes pre-configured with `preact-material-components` so that you can start using material design without any hassle.

- **Netlify CMS**

  If you're looking for your next blog, look no further. This template has Netlify CMS pre-configured and gives you a simple elegant blog for you.

To get started with these templates just do

```shell
preact create <template-name> <app-name>
```

This will create the folder and install all the dependencies.

```shell
cd <app-name>
npm run dev/build
```

## Production builds
Run `npm run build` to create production build which will reside in `build` directory in the app folder.

Production builds can be fine tuned to match your needs with a series of flags. Find the full linst of flags [here](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli#preact-build).

**Usage**

e.g.

This will generate webpack's asset json which can be used in a webpack [analyzer](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/).

```shell
preact build --json
```

## Editing index.html
If you want to add or edit the markup generated by `preact-cli` like add meta tags, adding additional scripts, or adding link tags for fonts, then you can edit the `template.html` in the `src` folder.
This is generated by `preact-cli` v3.

Otherwise, if you're upgrading from an old version you can create `template.html` in `src` folder which will be picked automatically.

The contacts of `template.html` markup looks like the following by default.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title><% preact.title %></title>
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
		<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
		<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
		<% preact.headEnd %>
	</head>
	<body>
		<% preact.bodyEnd %>
	</body>
</html>
```
