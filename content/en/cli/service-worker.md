# Going Offline with Preact CLI

Preact CLI comes bundled with [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox). It takes advantage of [InjectManifest](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin#injectmanifest_plugin_2) plugin to gain and give high flexibility and more control over service worker use cases.

Preact CLI gives offline capabilities to the pre-built javascript/css and pre-rendered deta out of the box.

**Note:** Preact CLI fetches navigation requests with [Network first](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook#network-falling-back-to-cache) approach, meaning that you users will always see fresh content unless they are offline.

## Custom functionality to you service worker

In order to make any changes to the default service worker functionality,

- Create a `sw.js` file in `src` folder.
- Paste the following snippet in this file to get the default functionality.

```js
self.__precacheManifest = [].concat(self.__precacheManifest || []);

const isNav = event => event.request.mode === 'navigate';

/**
 * Adding this before `precacheAndRoute` lets us handle all
 * the navigation requests even if they are in precache.
 */
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  ({ event }) => isNav(event),
  new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst({
    // this cache is plunged with every new service worker deploy so we dont need to care about purging the cache.
    cacheName: workbox.core.cacheNames.precache,
    networkTimeoutSeconds: 5, // if u dont start getting headers within 5 sec fallback to cache.
    plugins: [
      new workbox.cacheableResponse.Plugin({
        statuses: [200], // only cache valid responses, not opaque responses e.g. wifi portal.
      }),
    ],
  })
);

workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute(self.__precacheManifest, {});

workbox.routing.setCatchHandler(({ event }) => {
  if (isNav(event))
    return caches.match(workbox.precaching.getCacheKeyForURL('/index.html'));
  return Response.error();
});
```

- Make changes according to your needs

## Adding other routes to runtime caching

If you want to add other routes or your API calls to runtime caching, follow the following steps.

- Create a `sw.js` file in your `src` folder.
- Add the following code with you respective settings.

```js
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  ({url, event}) => {
    return (url.pathname === '/special/url');
  },
  workbox.strategies.<networkOnly/cacheOnly/cacheFirst/staleWhileRevalidate>()
);
```

- You can configure the the above snippet with `networkOnly` to make sure that `/special/url` is never cached in service worker.

**Note:** Any custom routing code should be put before `workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute(self.__precacheManifest, precacheOptions);`

## Using other workbox modules in your service worker

Preact CLI imports [worbox-sw](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-sw) in its service worker, thus all modules can be loaded on demand as you use them.
Feel free to use any module from workbox offering and it will be available on global scope of service worker at runtime.

e.g.: Adding Background sync

Add the following code to the bottom of your `sw.js`.

```js
const bgSyncPlugin = new workbox.backgroundSync.Plugin('myQueueName', {
  maxRetentionTime: 24 * 60 // Retry for max of 24 Hours (specified in minutes)
});

workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  /\/api\/.*\/*.json/,
  new workbox.strategies.NetworkOnly({
    plugins: [bgSyncPlugin]
  }),
  'POST'
);
```
