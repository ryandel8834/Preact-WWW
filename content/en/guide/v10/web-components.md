# Web Components

Due to its lightweight nature Preact is a popular choice for writing web components. Many use it to build a component system that is then wrapped into various web components. This allows you to easily re-use them in other projects where a completely different framework is used.

One thing to keep in mind is that Web Components don't replace Preact as they don't have the same goals.

## Rendering Web Components

From Preact's point of view, web components are just standard DOM-Elements. We can render them by using the registered tag name:

```jsx
function Foo() {
  return <x-foo />;
}
```

## Accessing Instance Methods

To be able to access the instance of your custom web component, we can leverage `refs`.

```jsx
function Foo() {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      myRef.current.doSomething();
    }
  }, []);

  return <x-foo ref={myRef} />;
}
```

## Triggering custom events

A web component might listen for custom events to add additional functionality. We can't make the same assumptions about casing like we can with native DOM events, so we pass the event name as is. We don't change the casing in any way there.

```jsx
// native DOM event -> add handler for "click" event
<div onClick={() => console.log('click')} />

// Custom Element
// Add handler for "IonChange" event
<my-foo onIonChange={() => console.log('IonChange')} />
// Add handler for "ionChange" event (note the casing)
<my-foo onionChange={() => console.log('IonChange')} />
```
