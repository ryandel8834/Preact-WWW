## What is Preact?

Preact is an attempt to recreate the core value proposition of React _(or similar libraries like Mithril)_ using as little code as possible, with first-class support for ES2015.  Currently the library is around **3kb** (minified & gzipped).

Preact retains a large amount of compatibility with React, but only the [stateless functional components] and [ES6 Classes] interfaces.
As one would expect coming from React, Components are simple building blocks for composing a User Interface.
