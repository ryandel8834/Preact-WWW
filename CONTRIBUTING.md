## Languages

Please author and submit content **only in one language** _(generally your primary written language)_ to facilitate translation.

Once the content is added, the wonderful folks who help maintain each translation will work to apply those changes to the other languages.

English is the site's default language and is generally the source for translations. Try to follow the existing formatting where possible.
